If you wonder about how long governors tend to live after their election based on their election dates we will talk about that.

our data comes from https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/IBKYRX and our question is how does the lifespan of governors after theve been elected compare to when theve been elected
our data might be sightly skewed as a woman has a different time in elections the the relations between sex and years lived could be changed
